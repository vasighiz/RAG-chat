Machine Learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning:
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Learns to map input to output
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest

2. Unsupervised Learning:
   - Works with unlabeled data
   - Finds patterns and relationships
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Common algorithms: K-means, PCA, DBSCAN

3. Reinforcement Learning:
   - Learns through trial and error
   - Uses rewards and penalties
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics
   - Common algorithms: Q-Learning, Policy Gradient

Key Concepts:
- Training Data: The dataset used to train the model
- Features: Input variables used for prediction
- Labels: Output variables to be predicted
- Model: The algorithm that makes predictions
- Hyperparameters: Parameters set before training
- Overfitting: When model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- Underfitting: When model fails to capture the underlying pattern
