Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. It has revolutionized many fields of artificial intelligence.

Neural Networks:
- Inspired by the human brain
- Consist of layers of interconnected nodes
- Each node processes input and passes output to the next layer
- Weights and biases are adjusted during training

Common Deep Learning Architectures:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
   - Specialized for processing grid-like data
   - Excellent for image recognition
   - Uses convolutional layers to detect features
   - Common in computer vision tasks

2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):
   - Designed for sequential data
   - Maintains memory of previous inputs
   - Variants include LSTM and GRU
   - Used in natural language processing

3. Transformers:
   - State-of-the-art architecture
   - Uses self-attention mechanism
   - Excels at parallel processing
   - Basis for models like BERT and GPT

Applications:
- Image and video recognition
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical image analysis
- Game playing (AlphaGo, AlphaZero)

Training Deep Learning Models:
- Requires large amounts of data
- Needs significant computational resources
- Often uses GPU acceleration
- Can take days or weeks to train
- Requires careful hyperparameter tuning
